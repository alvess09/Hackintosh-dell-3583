# HACKINGTOSH DELL Inspiron 3583 :alien:


I recently decided that I needed a Mac, but the high costs of a Macbook were not accessible to me, so I decided to use my laptop and do a Hackingtosh.
I installed Catalina but I currently use MacOs BigSur.
Here I provide the link to the files used to create Hackingtosh on the Dell Inspiron 3583.

## Issues
This is pretty good, but let's get the details.
- [x] Touchscreen
- [x] Touchpad Gestures
- [ ] Intel WiFi **Some users have reported that using Airportitlwm kexts will enable wifi, See #Intel WifI(in Catalina), however in BigSur Wifi / Bluetooth works.**
- [x] HDMI Audio
- [x] HDMI Video
- [x] Audio jack 
- [x] Function Keys (Workaround with Key Elements)
- [x] Sleep
- [x] Power Management
- [x] USB Ports
- [x] Handoff (Using DW1560)#2
- [x] iMessage
- [x] Airdrop (Using DW1560)#2
- [x] Unlock with Apple Watch (Only with DW1560, not Intel Wifi)

## Intel WiFi
* You can exchange the Wifi Card for the DW1560 that will work on Catalina, but I use Intel on BigSur and it works but still has slight bugs.
* You can use the Integrated card, but I haven't tested it on Catalina.
